Project Description: A full MERN stack web application. This application was built for autistic children and the professionals who provide them therapy. The app provides children with situations and detailed steps on how to handle said situation. The child's behavior analyst can customize the situations specific to the child and challenge the child to reach certain social goals. 

version 2.0: A future version will allow the child to click on a complete button after they complete each task. This will add to their score and potentially move them up the superhero leaderboard providing incentive for tackling difficult situations. I will add an administrative log in that provides full editable control to the settings and situations. I will also add a read only version the child can acces where only the comment field can be updated and the 'I did it!' button. links and flow will be updated to provide better user experience.
